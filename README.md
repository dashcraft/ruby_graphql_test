# README

Here's how to get this repo started....

## Graphql
All grapql items are located in the `app/graphql` folder

## DB setup
I used a dummy database with a dummy username and a dummy password.
You should probably change those to fit your needs lol.

## Rails
* The usual `bundle install`
* `rails db:migrate`
* `rails db:seed`

## Graphql Playground
Go to: `localhost:3000/graphql_playground`
You can use graphql to query and create tasks and view your users.
